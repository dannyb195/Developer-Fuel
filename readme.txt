Developer Fuels shows you the closest Coffee Shops or Places to grab a beer, right on the dashboard

== Description ==

Let's be honest... being a location independent developer or designer is pretty awesome.  We work at home, at conferences, or simply traveling, but all too often we have a billion tabs open in our browser!

Well I say NO MORE!  Developer Fuel provides the most important WordPress Admin UX update since MP6 by adding a widget right on your Dashboard to show either the closet Coffee Shops or Bars.  No longer will you have to get lost in a sea of Chrome tabs just to find a place to grab your drink of choice.

== Installation ==

- Upload the developer-fuel dir to your /plugins directory or just install via the WordPress Admin
- Get a Google Maps API key here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key
- Paste your Google Maps key in the dashboard widget field and set the times you would like to see coffee versus local bars

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= But what if I'm looking for a Kale Smoothie? =

This gets asked surprisingly often - Sadly Developer Fuel only supports Coffee and Local Bars at the moment
