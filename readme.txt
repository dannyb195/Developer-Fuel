Developer Fuels shows you the closest Coffee Shops or Places to grab a beer, right on the dashboard

== Description ==

Let's be honest... being a location independent developer or designer is pretty awesome.  We work at home, at conferences, or simply traveling, but all too often we have a billion tabs open in our browser!

Well I say NO MORE!  Developer Fuel provides the most important WordPress Admin UX update since MP6 by adding a widget right on your Dashboard to show either the closet Coffee Shops or Bars.  No longer will you have to get lost in a sea of Chrome tabs just to find a place to grab your drink of choice.

== Installation ==

- Upload the developer-fuel dir to your /plugins directory or just install via the WordPress Admin
- This plugin requires a Google Maps Embed API Key
	- Go here, https://console.developers.google.com
	- If you don't have any projects, create one. Or create one specifically for this, it's your choice
	- Click on the name of your project
	- Click 'Enable and API'
	- Search for 'Google Maps Embed API' and activate it
	- Click on 'Credentials' under APIs & auth in the left navigation
	- Click on 'Create new Key' under 'Public API access'
	- Click on 'Browser Key' when prompted and leave the next teext field empty, simply click 'Create'
	- Copy the API Key that was just generated and paste it in the Developer Fuel Google Maps Key text field
- Set the times you would like to see coffee versus local bars
